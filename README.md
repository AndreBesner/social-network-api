## Installation

Download source files and run `npm i` in order to install dependancies.


## Usage

Once depenancies are installed you can start the program by running `npm start`

You will now have a server running at port 3001, use insomnia to test the API routes for api/users and api/thoughts.

Make sure you create a user first, use this json as an example 

`{
  "username": "CHANGETHISTOWHATEVER",
  "email": "THISWILLBECHECKEDVALID"
}
`
